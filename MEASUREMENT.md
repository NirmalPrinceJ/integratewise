# Measurement Methodology

- **Baselines:** Capture trailing 2–4 quarters of churn, expansion, and efficiency data during assessment; freeze at executive readout.
- **Windows:** Primary evaluation window is 90 days post go-live with secondary 180- and 365-day checkpoints.
- **Exclusions:** Remove contractual churn (M&A, bankruptcy), out-of-scope products, and customers without adapter coverage.
- **Attribution:**
  - ChurnShield tasks → risk saves
  - DealDesk workflows → retained/expansion revenue
  - TemplateForge adoption → efficiency gains (CSM hours saved)
- **ROI formula:** `(Retained revenue + Expansion + Efficiency savings − Fees) / Fees` using a blended CSM hourly rate agreed up front.
