# Measurement Methodology

- **Baselines:** Trailing 90-day churn %, renewal rate, and CSM hours per account captured before go-live.
- **Windows:** Monthly measurement with quarterly rollups; 90-day time-to-value from first production health compute.
- **Exclusions:** Remove contracts with >50% value changes, mergers, and outages >24h unrelated to platform.
- **Attribution:** Credit churn reduction when risk flags precede renewals by ≥30 days; efficiency when playbooks replace manual tickets.
- **ROI:** (Retained Revenue + Efficiency Savings − Fees) / Fees; efficiency hours valued at loaded CSM rate.
